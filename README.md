## Description:
This workout tracker is a simple fitness tool which helps users input an exercise (cardio or resistance) that theyve completed, with the amount of weight/distance, the amount of reps and sets and the total duration, which saves in each individual workout. This allows users to compete with themselves to further improve and get the most out of their workouts! The app uses MongoDB, a database that captures information in the form of an object. This is a simpler, less strict way to gather and store information in a database, when compared to something like MySql and Sequalize. 

## Usage:
Simply visit the deploy app to get started!
